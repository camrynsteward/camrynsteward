    <p>Ben E. King</p>
    <p>When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me</p>
    <br/> 
    <p>So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me</p>
    <br/>
    <p>If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me</p>
    <br/>
    <p>And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by me</p>
